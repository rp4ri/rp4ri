## Hi there 👋, my name is Rodrigo Pari

I'm a data scientist and mathematician based in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. I'm usually travelling around the country. I love math and I'm always trying to learn something new.

In this GitHub account I upload small projects and prototypes that I make while learning new technologies. 🔭 I'm also trying to upload content from my current work to my GitHub Pages blog [rp4ri.github.io](https://rp4ri.github.io/)

In my free time, I like to read 📚 Latin American literature, 🎨 draw and paint, and try to combine my hobbies with my work.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. 🌎

## About me

- 🧉 I like to drink tereré while coding 🧉
- 📚 I'm trying to read Borges but I'm having trouble understanding all the references he makes 🤔
- 🤝 I'm involved in a volunteer project that uses technology to make useful applications for our society [labtecnosocial.org](https://labtecnosocial.org/) 🤝
- 🖥️ I'm fascinated by Artificial Intelligence because my computer can do seemingly human things like talk to me about literature or draw 🖥️
